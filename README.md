Chat App

This is a chat app that uses a Firebase realtime database to store and fetch message data. 

It was made using ReactJS

Users can either send and read messages as a guest, or sign in using a Google account. Users may select an existing room to join, or create a new room. Once a room has been selected, messages appear in sequential order and display a timestamp of when the message was sent.
